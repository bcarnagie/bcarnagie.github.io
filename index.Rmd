## Who am I?

My name is Brianna Carnagie and I am currently pursuing an MPH degree at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, where my passion lies in advocating for healthcare equity. My academic focus centers on Epidemiology, Applied Biostatistics, and Public Health Data Science.

With *3+ years* of public health experience under my belt, my background includes meaningful work with vulnerable populations, particularly in the realm of biostatistics and data analytics. My ability to forge collaborative partnerships has allowed me to work effectively with a diverse array of stakeholders, showcasing my leadership and communication skills.

Driven by a deep commitment to effecting change in public health, I bring together my education and hands-on experience to contribute positively to the transformation of our healthcare system.
