# Plotly

We're making interactive plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)

library(p8105.datasets)
```



Focus on NYC Airbnb data.

```{r}
data("rest_inspec")

rest_inspec_bronx = rest_inspec |> 
  select(boro, building, critical_flag, cuisine_description, dba, score, zipcode) |> 
  drop_na(score) |> 
  filter( boro == "BRONX", score >=30) 

rest_inspec_allboros = rest_inspec |> 
  select(boro, building, critical_flag, cuisine_description, dba, score, zipcode, inspection_date) |> 
  drop_na(score) |> 
  filter(score >=30) |> sample_n(1000, replace = FALSE)


rest_inspec |> count(cuisine_description)
  
```

Let's make a scatterplot!

```{r}

rest_inspec_allboros %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~inspection_date, y = ~score, color = ~boro, 
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", marker = list(size = 10, opacity = 0.5)) 
```

Let's make a box plot!

```{r}
 rest_inspec %>% filter(boro != "Missing", score >=0) |> 
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, score)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~boro, y = ~score,
    type = "box", colors = "viridis") 
```


Let's make a bar plot!

```{r}
 rest_inspec_bronx %>%
  count(cuisine_description) %>%
  mutate(cuisine_description = fct_reorder(cuisine_description, n)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~cuisine_description, y = ~n, color = ~cuisine_description,
    type = "bar", colors = "viridis")

```
